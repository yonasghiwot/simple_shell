                  Overview

Welcome to our simple shell proejct! This project is all about creating a shell which is written in C programming language.

              Simple Shell

Simple shell is a basic command-line interpreter. It provides a basic interface for users to interact with their computer, allowing them to execute commands, navigate the file system, and manage processes.

Environment :

Our shell was built and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Features

***Ask the user to enter a command and wait for their response, making sure that every command ends in a newline.

***display an error message and prompt the user once more if it is unable to locate an executable.

***Put error-handling procedures in place to handle unforeseen circumstances with compassion.

***Use the Ctrl+D keyboard shortcut to handle the termination condition (end of file).

***Allow argument-containing command lines.

***Executables can be found by using the PATH environment variable.
Maintain exit statuses and provide support for the exit command feature.

***Stop the shell from ending when the user hits the Ctrl-C key.

***Control the command separators (;) to make different commands stand out.

***Take care of logical operators for conditional execution, like && and ||.

***Replace special variables like $? and $$ with variable replacements.
Process the comments that the # symbol indicates.

***Support a historical characteristic to recall previous commands.

***Enable file input to execute commands from a file.
